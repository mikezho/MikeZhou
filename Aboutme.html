	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<img src="about-me.jpg" height="200">
	
	<p>I like Computer Science, and I also like to play chess, badminton, soccer, and videogames. 
	<br/>This is my third year in America. I am currently a junior in Damien High School, California. I like to play soccer, chess, and video games.
	<br/>
	<br/>how do I like America: America is a good country with many high-technology products, high-speed internet, etc. People are friendly and outgoing. But sometimes cultural differences cause awkwardness.
